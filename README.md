YOLOv5 🚀 is the efficient loved vision AI, representing <a href="https://ultralytics.com">Ultralytics</a> open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

YOLOv5 can be used for real-time detection of obstacles, pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, as well as industrial defect detection, such as detecting product defects or anomalies on the production line, water level detection, etc.

This paper uses the Yolov5 model to detect water level conditions. By integrating the YOLOv5 algorithm into the front-end processing system, real-time and efficient processing of water level monitoring data is achieved. The YOLOv5 model is optimized and trained to meet the specific needs of water level monitoring. By collecting a large amount of water level image data in different scenes and considering factors such as different time periods, distances, angles, and environments, the diversity and authenticity of the data set are guaranteed. In addition, the paper also compares the performance of YOLOv5 with other target detection algorithms (such as ResNet50, PVT-S, TwinsP-S, Swin-T, etc.). The experimental results show that the experimental indicators all perform well.

<summary>Inference with detect.py</summary>

`detect.py` runs inference on a variety of sources, downloading [models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) and saving results to `runs/detect`.

```bash

<summary>Training</summary>

The commands below reproduce YOLOv5 [COCO](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/blob/master/data/scripts/get_coco.sh) results. [Models](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/models) and [datasets](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/master/data) download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 [release](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases). Training times for YOLOv5n/s/m/l/x are 1/2/4/6/8 days on a V100 GPU ([Multi-GPU](https://docs.ultralytics.com/yolov5/tutorials/multi_gpu_training) times faster). Use the largest `--batch-size` possible, or pass `--batch-size -1` for YOLOv5 [AutoBatch](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/pull/5092). Batch sizes shown for V100-16GB.
